## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** - Download and install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB** - Download and install or use MongoDB Atlas.

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mayurk224/Book_Store_App-Backend.git
   cd Book_Store_App-Backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add your MongoDB connection string and any other environment variables:
   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5555
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:5555` by default.

### Frontend Setup
1. Clone the frontend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-frontend-repo-url.git](https://github.com/mayurk224/Book_Store_App-Frontend)
   cd Book_Store_App-Frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root folder and set the API URL:
   ```plaintext
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5555
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## üìë API Endpoints

The backend API provides the following endpoints for managing books:

- **GET** `/books` - Get all books.
- **POST** `/books` - Add a new book.
- **PUT** `/books/:id` - Update an existing book by ID.
- **DELETE** `/books/:id` - Delete a book by ID.
